This is a sample CV using the hugo-resume theme. This is intended for educational purposes only! 
 
Please do not distribute any of the images associated with this project. If you use this as your template for your CV, go to the "static/img" folder and delete all of the images and replace with your own (hint, use the same image names, like qr-code.png, and you don't have to recode).

100% of my students who used this template landed a job!  She was really happy.

<img id="qr-code" class="card-img-top" alt="Mr. Krabs smiling at you" src="{{ "img/Mr._Krabs.png" | absURL }}">
