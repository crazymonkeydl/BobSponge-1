Please do not distribute any of the images associated with this project. If you use this as your template for your CV, go to the "static/img" folder and delete all of the images and replace with your own (hint, use the same image names, like qr-code.png, and you don't have to recode).

100% of my students who used this template landed a job!  She was really happy.
