## About me

I am currently a PhD student at Louisiana Tech, specializing in Industrial-Organizational Psychology. My academic journey is driven by a passion for understanding and optimizing workplace dynamics, employee well-being, and organizational effectiveness.

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I proudly served in the United States Marine Corps as a parachute rigger. This experience instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, attention to detail, and a commitment to excellenceâ€”qualities that I carry into my current research and professional endeavors.

In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of science fiction and expressing my creativity through painting miniatures. These hobbies not only provide a relaxing escape but also inspire innovative thinking and a meticulous approach to my work.

I am dedicated to advancing the field of Industrial-Organizational Psychology and look forward to contributing to research and practices that enhance organizational performance and employee satisfaction.
